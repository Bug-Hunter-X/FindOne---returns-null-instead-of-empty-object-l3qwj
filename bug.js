```javascript
const query = { name: 'John Doe' };

db.collection('users').findOne(query, { projection: { _id: 0, email: 1 } });
```
This code attempts to retrieve only the `email` field from the `users` collection, excluding the `_id`. However, if the `users` collection doesn't have a document matching the query, it will still return `null`, which could be mistaken for an empty object.  This can lead to unexpected behavior if the code subsequently attempts to access properties within the returned object.

```javascript
//Error handling in case no document is found
const user = db.collection('users').findOne(query, { projection: { _id: 0, email: 1 } });
if(user){ 
  console.log(user.email)
} else{
  console.log('No user found');
}
```
